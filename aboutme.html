Hello! My name is Mack, and I'm a highschooler. Last year computor science was a mandatory class for me to take but I actually enjoyed it and that is why I decided to take it as an elective this year. I am an athlete and thouroughly enjoy playing softball, tennis, and basketball. Being on a team and participating in competition brings me so much joy. I have lived in New York my whole life and have been at my school since kindergarten. One of my favorite restaurants is called Poke and I love going there with my friends to get this special dish called the tuna bomb. It is SOOOO good I highly recommend. I am a huge fan of the NY Yankees and the NY Giants and love following those two sports. That's a little bit to get to know me and thanks for visiting my website!
